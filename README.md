A python GUI app that asks the user what emotion (or any keyword) they are feeling. You enter a word (ex: funny) and the python program sends it to the youtube api and looks through youtube for a video with "funny" (or any keyword) in the title. It than returns the title, thumbnail, and a link to the youtube video. 

This demonstrates my abilitiy with python and APIs.
